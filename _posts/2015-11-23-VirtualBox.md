VirtualBox

Recentlyï¼ŒI installed the latest version of VirtualBox by downloading the deb file from virtualbox.org
on Ubuntu 14.04,The installation goes fine,but today it reports the follow error after updating the 
sysytem.

> Kernel driver not installed (rc=-1908)

Looks like some kernel driver has to be compiled for Virtualbox to run properly. But this is easy enough on Ubuntu and does not require a lot of effort. And here are the steps to do the necessary.

First install the kernel headers and build tools.

    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential module-assistant 
    $ sudo m-a prepare

And now compile virtualbox kernel driver with the commanded as reported by the error message earlier.

    $ sudo /etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup

The compilation should go fine and finish within a few minutes with an output similar to what is shown below.

    $ sudo /etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup
    Stopping VirtualBox kernel modules ...done.
    Recompiling VirtualBox kernel modules ...done.
    Starting VirtualBox kernel modules ...done.

Now run Virtualbox again and it should run fine.
